_course project_
## What are the objectives of this project?
* Improve DOM manipulation skills.
* Get had in using ES6 classes and implementing OOP principles.
## What does the interface look like?
This is a classical snake game with a simple interface that consists of a game field, a snake, and food items. The snake starts out as a small line of two cells. It moves around the game field and grows as it eats the food. Each food item eaten adds another cell to its tail. The player's score increases each time the snake eats a food item. The game is over if the snake runs into a wall or its own body. The player's goal is to keep the snake alive and score as many points as possible by eating food items.
The player's current score and best score are displayed in the scoreboard above the game field.
## How to play?
Use arrow keys to control the movements - up, down, left, and right.
